# LetLogin Toolbox

This extension is a simple version of LetLogin, which focuses on Danish context and providers. LetLogin Toolbox is generic - primarily focused on fixing Youtube's cookie problem and adding the possibility to generate direct links to photos.

The Youtube fix concerns the problem that appears when you disable Youtube for your GSfE domain - your users cannot login. Youtube sets cookies saving consent and settings, and these fail and have failed for quite some time now - so that's the reason for the fix :-)

The other part is the possibility to generate direct links for pictures in the users Google Drive. See the Documentation folder, for a screenshot.

To prepare this extension for distribution on your domain download this code from Github and unzip it. I recommend testing locally on your own chromebook/chrome browser via chrome://extensions/ and importing unpacked. Chose the folder (don't enter the folder)

After testing okay, submit the extension to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/ . You need to pay a 5$ fee - dont ask me why. Create and submit the extension as "Private" and only visible to your own domain.

Any comments are welcome and any improvement to the code is very welcome!

Good luck :-)
